Use morrowplots to load, explore, and analyze nearly 150 years of agricultural data from the historic [Morrow Plots](https://aces.illinois.edu/research/history/morrow-plots) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). Data collection and formats have evolved over time, and this dataset was created to aggregate decades of tabular data (previously in various physical and digital forms) into a format compatible with the R programming language. Vignettes provide mini lessons on the history of the Morrow Plots and example code for exploration of the data.

## Installation

You can install the **stable** version from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=morrowplots).

```r
install.packages("morrowplots")
```

You can install the **development** version [Github](https://github.com/SandiCal/morrowplots):

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SandiCal/morrowplots")
```

## Structure

Data is structured as a dataframe in the [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format so that each
variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each
value has its own cell.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
## preview first 12 rows of data
library(morrowplots)
library(knitr)
kable(morrowplots[1:12, ])
```

## Variables

The codebook that describes all variables is available in the help documentation.

```{r}
help(morrowplots)
```
 
Including: 
```{r, echo = F, results = "asis"}
## display just the variables and definitions from the help supplied by data.R; hard coded here as "lines = 38:100" 
help_console <- function(topic, format=c("text", "html", "latex", "Rd"),
                         lines=NULL, before=NULL, after=NULL) {  
  format=match.arg(format)
  if (!is.character(topic)) topic <- deparse(substitute(topic))
  helpfile = utils:::.getHelpFile(help(topic))
  hs <- capture.output(switch(format, 
                              text=tools:::Rd2txt(helpfile),
                              html=tools:::Rd2HTML(helpfile),
                              latex=tools:::Rd2latex(helpfile),
                              Rd=tools:::prepare_Rd(helpfile)
                              )
                      )
  if(!is.null(lines)) hs <- hs[lines]
  hs <- c(before, hs, after)
  cat(hs, sep="\n")
  invisible(hs)
}

help_console(morrowplots, "html", lines = 38:102)
```
